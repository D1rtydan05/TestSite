                <p>I have always worked better with computers rather than
                    sports in my life. I have been around them and learned 
                    how they work at a young age with the help of my father.
                    So naturally that curiosity about how computers work led
                    to coding and I have always been passionate about it.</p>

                <p>Video games have been played a big part in my life. So much 
                    so that I took every opportunity i had to try and create 
                    them. Ever since elementary, there was a starter club 
                    after school to use programs on computers to learn and 
                    create videogames. I understand JavaScript and basic 
                    functions and know how to make simpler games but it's a 
                    start.</p>
